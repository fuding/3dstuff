2nd Z axis rod for K8200 printer.
Extra parts to attach this thing:  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:235494 (not my thing) to the right hand side of a K8200
Z axis gantry for more stability.

Work in progress. There are some issues with the holes being close to the edge, but they do print ok.

2nd z axis.stl attaches to the Z arm gantry thing, on the right (when looking at the printer from the front)

2nd z axis bearing mounts.stl go on the right hand upright support on the front side of the upright.
