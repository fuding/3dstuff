K8200 / 3Drag printer Y belt tensioner.

Installation can be done with the printer fully assembled. 
You just need to remove the front crossmember to get at the bolt holding the alu bracket on for the original pulley. 

You'll need:  
1x M3 bolt 15mm long  
2x M4 bolts 15mm long
4x M4 washers  
2x M4 nuts (locking or otherwise)  
2x M3 bolts 10mm long  

Optional (depending how big your fingers are)
Pair of tweezers

To install:  
Remove front crossmember to gain access to the bolt holding the aluminium bearing bracket on.

Remove original bearing (completely dismantle as we will use it again)  

Slide the base in with the uprights facing the back of the printer and sit it against the front solid Y bar mount to keep it out of the way for now. 

Slide the tensioner part in from the back of the printer. 
Angle it up 90 degrees (with the single screw hole up in the air) and push it under the X axis rod.
Give it a bit of a wiggle and gently bring it flat as you push it through.  

Put an M4 washer on an M4 x 15mm bolt, insert into base from top, use printed washer on the bottom of the chassis, followed by an M4 washer and lock nut. 
 
Use 2 x M3 10mm bolts through the uprights in the base, into the tensioner part. Don't over tighten, they are just a hinge. 

Now take all the parts from the original bearing setup and insert the original M5 bolt into the tensioner with a small m5 washer. 

Poke enough of the screw in to hold on to 3 washers. Put a small washer on, large washer, another small washer. 

At this point make sure the belt is also in there. 

Now insert the bearing using a pair of tweezers (don't damage it). 
  
Push more of the bolt through and put the other washers on: small washer, big washer, small washer.  

Push the bolt all the way through and install another small washer and the locking nut.  

Screw the remaining M3 15mm bolt into the single hole at the end of the tensioner arm and screw down until the desired belt tension is achieved.
